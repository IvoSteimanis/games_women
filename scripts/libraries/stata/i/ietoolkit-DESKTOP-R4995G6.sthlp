{title:Description}

{pstd}{inp:ietoolkit} This command returns the version of {inp:ietoolkit} installed. It can be used  to programmatically test if {inp:ietoolkit} is already installed.

{pstd}This command does not take any options.
{p_end}

{title:Examples}

{pstd}The code below is an example code that can be added to the top of any do-file.  The example code first tests if the command is installed, and install it if not. If it is installed, it tests if the version is less than version 5.0. If it is, it replaces the {inp:ietoolkit} file with the latest version. In your code you can skip the second part if you are not sure which version is required. But you should always have the first part testing that {inp:r(version)} has a value before using it in less than or greater than expressions. 
{p_end}

{input}{space 8}cap ietoolkit
{space 8}if "`r(version)'" == "" { 
{space 8}  *ietoolkit not installed, install it
{space 8}  ssc install ietoolkit
{space 8}}
{space 8}else if `r(version)' < 5.0 { 
{space 8}  *ietoolkit version too old, install the latest version
{space 8}  ssc install ietoolkit , replace
